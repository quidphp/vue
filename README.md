## Setup
Once the installation is complete, simply follow these steps:
1. Make sure the [storage](storage) and [public](public) folders are writable by your web server. For [storage](storage) also make sure all subdirectories are writable.
2. Configure an Apache Virtual Host or Nginx Server Block in order to have a domain pointing to the [public](public) folder document root.
3. Import [db.sql](db.sql) within a new Mysql/MariaDB database.
4. Duplicate the [env-default.php](env-default.php) file and rename it to **env.php**.
5. Update the scheme hosts within the **env.php** file. You will need to set a different host (domain or subdomain) for the application and the CMS.
6. Update the database parameters within the **env.php** file.
7. Not required, but you are encouraged to change the namespace of all PHP classes within the [src](src) folder. The default namespace is Project.

## Booting
There are two ways to boot the application or CMS.

### HTTP
From your web browser, enter the URL to the [public/index.php](public/index.php) entry file. The host used will determine if the application or CMS is booted.

### CLI
Open the project folder in the Command Line. Then submit a command that should be in the following format: **php quid [path][:envType]**.

The *envType* determines if the application or CMS needs to be booted (and also in which environment). If the *envType* is not specified, the system will fallback to the *cliEnvType* value within the **env.php** file. Exemple:
``` bash
$ php quid /en/my-url
$ php quid /en/my-url:dev/cms
$ php quid /:dev/app
```

## Credentials
Once you open the CMS within your browser, you will need to login. The default user:
- Username: **admin** 
- Password: **changeme123**

Once you are logged in, you will be able to change the password for the user and create new users.
