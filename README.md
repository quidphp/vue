## Setup
Once the installation is complete, simply follow these steps:
1. Make sure the [storage](storage) and [public](public) folders are writable by your web server. For [storage](storage) also make sure all subdirectories are writable.
2. Configure an Apache Virtual Host or Nginx Server Block in order to have a domain pointing to the [public](public) folder document root.
3. Import [db.sql](db.sql) within a new Mysql/MariaDB database.
4. Duplicate the [env-default.php](env-default.php) file and rename it to **env.php**.
5. Update the scheme hosts within the **env.php** file. You will need to set a different host (domain or subdomain) for the application and the CMS.
6. Update the database parameters within the **env.php** file.
7. Not required, but you are encouraged to change the namespace of all PHP classes within the [src](src) folder. The default namespace is Project.

## Booting via Webpack/HTTP
Open the project folder in the Command Line. To start the development server with hot module reload (HMR) write:
``` bash
npm run hot
```
Your application will be reachable at the defined host within your *env.php* file. A second Node server is also started to serve the HMR requests (defaults to localhost on port 8079). You may need to accept the self-signed certificate for that localhost.

## Webpack production build
To generate the production build for the Vue application, open the project folder in the Command Line and write:
``` bash
npm run prod
```

## QuidPHP CLI routes
Open the project folder in the Command Line. You may now submit a command in the following format: 
``` bash
php quid [path][:envType]
exemple:
php quid /en/my-url
php quid /en/my-url:dev/cms
php quid /:prod/app
```

## LemurCMS credentials
Once you open the CMS within your browser, you will need to login. The default user is:
- Username: **admin** 
- Password: **changeme123**

Once you are logged in, you will be able to change the password for the user and create new users.

## Testing
**QuidPHP** testsuite can be run by creating a new [QuidPHP/Assert](https://github.com/quidphp/assert) project.
